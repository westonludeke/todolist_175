# Todo List - RB175

Created a simple todo list app in Sinatra, Ruby, HTML, and CSS as part of Launch School's RB175 course. 

[The project is live on Heroku here](https://vast-gorge-88966.herokuapp.com). 

Note: The CSS files and images were developed by Launch School. All of the Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, and Javscript code is my own written as part of the course. Students are given instructions and implement the app on their own based on the parameters in the instructions.
