# Todo List - RB175

Created a simple todo list app in Sinatra, Ruby, HTML, and CSS as part of Launch School's RB175 course. 

[The project is live on Heroku here](https://vast-gorge-88966.herokuapp.com). 

About: The CSS files and images were developed by Launch School. All of the Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, and Javscript code is my own written as part of the course. Students are given instructions and implement the app on their own based on the parameters in the instructions.

Bugs: If a todo list is deleted and several other todo lists remain, it causes problems due to how the different lists are shown on the site. I need to go back and fix this in the future. Also, the jquery isn't working to properly show warning/confirmation messages.
